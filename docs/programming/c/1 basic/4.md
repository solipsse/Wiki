# operator
## relational
Relational operators compare two values. Examples include `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`.

## arithmetic
Arithmetic operators perform mathematical operations. Examples include `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `++`, `--`

## assignment
arithmetic (except`++` and `--`), and bitwise (except `~`) can be put before `_=` e.g. `x &= 2` $\equiv$ `x = x & 2`

## logical
Logical operators combine boolean expressions. Examples include `&&`, `||`, `!`

## bitwise
Bitwise operators perform operations on bits. Examples include `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`

### operator precedence and associativity
determine the order of operations in complex expressions.
