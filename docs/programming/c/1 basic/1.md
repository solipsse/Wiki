# compiler
A C compiler is an operating system program that converts C language statements into machine language equivalents. Different C compilers include GCC, Clang, and MSVC.

### installation
- **GCC**: Install using package managers like `apt` on Ubuntu or `brew` on macOS.
- **Clang**: Often comes pre-installed on macOS or can be installed via package managers.
- **MSVC**: Available with Visual Studio on Windows.

### basic usage commands
- To compile a program: `gcc filename.c -o outputname`
- To run the compiled program: `./outputname`

### compilation process
1. **Preprocessing**: Handles directives like `#include` and `#define`.
2. **Compilation**: Translates the preprocessed code into assembly language.
3. **Assembly**: Converts assembly code into machine code.
4. **Linking**: Combines object files into a single executable.
