# program structure
## header files and preprocessor directives
Header files contain declarations for functions and macros. Common header files include:
- `<stdio.h>`: Standard input/output functions.
- `<stdlib.h>`: General utility functions.

## role of preprocessor directives
Preprocessor directives like `#include`, `#define`, and `#ifdef` are used to include libraries and define constants.

## main function
The `main()` function is the entry point of a C program. It usually returns an integer value, typically 0, to indicate successful execution.

## whitespace
whitespace and indentation are ignore in c due to encapsulation and ending symbol e.g. {} ;

```c
// code like this is also valid
int blockVar = 20; printf("Block Variable: %d\n", blockVar); //... more code*
```
## comments
```
`//` inline comment
`/* */` block comment
```
