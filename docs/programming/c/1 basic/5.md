# function
## declaration and call
Functions must be declared before they are called. The declaration specifies the function's return type and parameters.

## prototypes and scope
Function prototypes provide information about the function to the compiler. Scope determines where a function can be called.

## standard I/O
Standard input/output functions include `printf()` for output and `scanf()` for input.

## string handling
Functions for handling strings include `strlen()`, `strcpy()`, and `strcat()`. These are defined in `<string.h>`.

## Function pointers
allow for dynamic function calls, enabling callback functions and state machines.
## Recursion
