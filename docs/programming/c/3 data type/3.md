# struct
## definition and declaration
Structures are user-defined data types that group related variables. They are defined using the `struct` keyword.

## member, init and access
Members of a structure can be accessed using the dot operator (`.`). Structures can be initialized at declaration.

## nested and array of structure
Structures can contain other structures (nested) and can be declared as arrays to store multiple instances.

## unions: definition declaration and use
Unions are similar to structures but can store different data types in the same memory location.

## bit field

## typedef and complex data types
