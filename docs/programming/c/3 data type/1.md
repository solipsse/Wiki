# array
!!! note
    - Homogeneous Elements
    - Contiguous Memory Allocation
    - Zero-Based Indexing
## declare, init, manipulation
Arrays are collections of elements of the same type. They can be declared, initialised, and manipulated using indexing.
```c
// init
type array[size];

// declare and init
type array[] = {element, element, ...}; // size is inferred

// accesssing
array[index] // give element at that index
array[index] = element // assign and update 1element

// more dimension
type matrix[row][col]...;
```

!!! tip "Why use or !use"
    - Efficient Memory Usage: Arrays provide a way to store multiple values in a single variable, reducing the need for multiple variable declarations.
    - Fast Access: Elements can be accessed quickly using their index, making arrays suitable for algorithms that require frequent data retrieval.
    - Ease of Iteration: Arrays can be easily traversed using loops, allowing for efficient processing of elements.

## character string and arrays explain
Character strings are arrays of characters terminated by a null character (`'\0'`). They can be manipulated using string functions.
