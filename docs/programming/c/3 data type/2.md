# pointer
## basic, declare
Pointers are variables that store memory addresses. They can be declared using the `*` operator.

## pointer arithmetic and array
Pointer arithmetic allows traversal of arrays using pointers. For example, `ptr++` moves to the next element.

## dynamic memory allocation
Dynamic memory can be allocated using `malloc()`, `calloc()`, and freed using `free()`.

## pointer and function
Pointers can be passed to functions to allow for call-by-reference, enabling modification of the original variable.

## pointer and structure
Pointers can also be used with structures to access structure members dynamically.
