# break and continue
- `break`: instantly exit the current most inner loop or switch block
- `continue`: skip the current most inner loop

## post-condition loop with infinite loop
=== "code"
    ```c
    int i = 0;
    while (1) {
        i++;
        if (i == 3) break;
    }
    ```
=== "result"
    ```i = 0 -> i = 1 -> i = 2```

    at i = 3, the break stops the loop
