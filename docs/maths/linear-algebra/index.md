## axis convention in mathematic

In algebra class, we are used to representing the plane's veritcal direction as the $\text{y-axis}$. However, in 3D space, $\text{xy-plane}$ form the horizontal plane and the $\text{z-axis}$ is the vertical axis.
## basis vector
!!! tip
	- vector:
	- scalar:
	- unit vector: 
	- linear combination:
	- span: 
	- linearly dependent: 
	- linearly independent: 

$$\begin{align}
\vec{v}\text{ is a linear combination of the basis vector}: \quad \vec{v}  & =  a\hat{v_{1}} + b\hat{v}_{2} + \dots \\
\text{span}: \quad S & = \{\vec{v} : \vec{v} \text{ is a linear combination of the basis vector}\} \\
\vec{v}: 
\end{align}$$

The convention reflect our right hand. The index , palm, and thumb points toward $\hat{i}, \hat{j}, \hat{k}$ respectively. 

!!! tip
	orientation is flip when the space flip around. This happend when either $\hat{i}, \hat{j}, \hat{k}$ points to the opposite direction. If the total number of flips of any of the bases is even then the orientation remains the same base vector

!!! note ""
	play around to see this in action

## operation on vector
### addition

$$\begin{align}
 v  & = \langle a_{1},b_{1}\rangle \\
 u  & = \langle a_{2}, b_{2} \rangle \\ \\
v+u  & = \begin{pmatrix}
a_{1} + a_{2}\\ b_{1} + b_{2}
\end{pmatrix} \\
v-u  & = \begin{pmatrix}
a_{1} - a_{2}\\ b_{1} - b_{2} 
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align}$$
