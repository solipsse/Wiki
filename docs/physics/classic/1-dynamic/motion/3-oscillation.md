# oscillation

- oscillation: back and forth movement 2
- phase diff in context of oscillation
## SHM
!!! note
	SHM is a 1D projection of motion in a circular motion, either the x/y



- KE <-> PE
- resistive force -> damping
- light, critical, heavy damping & s-t graphs

### energy

- resonance: f of forced oscillation = natural f -> vibration with $A_{max}$
