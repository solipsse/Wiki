!!! tip
	- friction are the tangential component of the reaction force $\vec{R}$
	- two types of friction are experience by a mass (acted by a driving force) depending on their motion (static or kinetic). $f(\mathcal{D},v)$ act at opposite direction to the driving force.
$$\begin{align}
 & \text{consider } (\mathcal{D},v) \text{ where } \mathcal{D},v,f \text{ are} \parallel \text{and } f \propto -\mathcal{D} \\
 & (0,0): \quad f= 0 \\
 & (n,0): \quad 0<f_{s}<f_{max} \\
 & (n,n): \quad f_{k}<f_{max}
\end{align}$$

For all of these cases $N=k$ (does not depend on $\mathcal{D} \text{ or }v$)
!!! tip
	- $\mu :$ coefficient of friction between two specific surfaces
	- $f_{max}=\mu_{s}N$ 
	- $f_{k}=\mu_{k}N$
	- $f_{s}\leq f_{max}$
	- $f_{k}<f_{max}$
??? question "what does $\mu$ depend on?"
	- the property of two specific surfaces

!!! note "misc from the [website](https://physics.info/friction)"
	- Recently it has been shown that the lubricant properties of graphite disappear under ultra high vacuum, and hence that molecules of gases, such as oxygen and nitrogen, most probably act as a kind of molecular grease to help the sheets slide past each other.
	- Roughness is a minor factor affecting friction. Friction is often higher between smooth surfaces. Insects can walk on windows.
	- If friction is independent of surface roughness, why do tires have tread? Tire tread sheds water.
	- Teflon has such a low coefficient of friction that it often peels off of pots and pans. (Use wooden or plastic utensils.) How do you get it to stick? Dreadlocks analogy: Teflon is a polymer, individual strands of hair are slippery, but strands can tangle to the point where they can't be separated.
	- Humans have little body hair. Why are certain areas still densely covered with hair? Evolutionary advantages. Describe them!
	- Dynamic friction even exist on the galactic scale. The gravitational tug of passing planets is much the same as the electrostatic forces between passing atoms. The coherent motion of groups of planets will eventually degrade into the random motion of individual planets.
