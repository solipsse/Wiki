# forces
## contact force (solid-solid)
- tension-compression $\mathbf{T}$
- push-pull *applied* force $\mathbf{F_{i}}$ or $\mathbf{F_{xy}}$ (force "on" x "by" y)
	- if it's a driving force $\mathcal{D}$
- surface reaction $\mathbf{\vec{R}}$ 
	- $\parallel \text{ friction } f$
	- $\perp \text{ normal }\mathbf{N}$
## contact force (solid-fluid)
- drag $\mathbf{D}$
- lift $\mathbf{L}$
- thrust $\mathbf{P}$
- upthrust $\mathbf{U}$ (or buoyancy)
## non-contact force (fields related force)
- electrostatic force $\mathbf{E}$
- magnetic force $\mathbf{B}$
- gravitational force (or weight $\mathbf{W}$):
- strong nuclear interaction
- weak nuclear interaction
??? question "what is a field?"
	*a region of space* (or area but 3D) where *something* experience a force.
	
	> "an area of effect ability that only affect certain characters" - me
## fictitious forces 
- centrifugal force
- coriolis force
- "G force": Not really a force (or even a fictitious force) but rather an apparent gravity-like sensation experienced by objects in an accelerating coordinate system.
## Effect of force on translational motion
- $\text{n2l}:$result in net change acceleration $F=ma + \dot{m}v$
- in circular motion
	- centripedal force $\mathbf{F_{r}}$ (direction of radius)
	- tangetiail force $\mathbf{F_{t}}$
- Generally $\Sigma \vec{F} = \begin{pmatrix}\Sigma F_{x} \\  \Sigma F_{y}\end{pmatrix}$
!!! tip "what about the effect of force on rotational motion?"
	this idea is analogous by using $\tau$ and $\alpha$ instead of $F$ and $a$ since they are define with similar DE.
