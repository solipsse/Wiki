# equilibrium
!!! tip
	$$\begin{align}
	 & \text{translational equilibrium }\triangleq (\Sigma F =0)  \\
     &\therefore v =k \\ \\
	 & v=0 \> \text{ system is static} \\
	 & v\neq 0  \text{ system is dynamic}
	\end{align}$$
!!! tip
	this idea can be extended from translational equilibrium $\Sigma F = 0$ to rotational/angular equilibrium $\Sigma\tau=0$
!!! warning
	$$\text{equilibrium}\triangleq \text{(translational equilibrium)} \land \text{(rotational equilibrium)}$$
## dynamic


## static




> The word equilibrium also has a thermodynamic meaning. Thermodynamics is the branch of physics that treats heat (the thermo part) as another form of energy (the dynamics part). Equilibrium in thermodynamics occurs when the internal energy entering a system is balanced by an equal amount of internal energy exiting the system. Net internal energy in transfer from one place to another is called heat. When a system no longer exchanges heat with its surroundings, it's said to be in thermodynamic equilibrium. The image this kind of equilibrium evokes is nothing like placid picture of forces combining politely to produce rest or unchanging velocity. Thermodynamic equilibrium is active and lively. It's an example of a dynamic equilibrium. I used the article "an" because there are others. When the rate of evaporation equals the rate of condensation, that's an example of dynamic equilibrium. When the rate at which nitrogen dissolves into water equals the rate at which it undissolves back into the air, that's another example. Once again, save it for later.
