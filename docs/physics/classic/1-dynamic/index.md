## system and forces
!!! info
	- system and surrounding
	- external vs internal force
	- system and surrounding force
!!! info
	- types of force: contact vs non-contact
	- fundamental force: all force in universe can be describe with the fundamental interaction. These forces are all non-contact force
	- fictitious forces: apparent (forces) on mass experience in an accelerating coordinate system as a consequence of trying to keep up with an accelerating environment.
	- restoring force: type of force that cause oscilltory motion
!!! tip "some definition"
	- inertia is a resistance to change (or acceleration)
	- force is an interaction between system, and only external force can cause change of system (acceleration and energy)

!!! tip "n1l $\> (1)$"
	a mass's state of motion can't be change ($\forall t \hspace{12px}v=k \in \mathbb{R}$) *unless* acted upon by external net force
!!! tip "n2l $\> (2)$"
	$$\begin{align}
	F & = \dot{p} \\
	 & =\dot{(mv)}  \\
     & = m\dot{v} + \dot{m}v \\
	\text{for } m=k: \quad F & \equiv ma
	\end{align}$$
??? info "n1l, n2l analogous in other form"

!!! tip "n3l $\> (3)$"
	for all interaction between masses, the force:
	
	- $F_{ba}=-F_{ab}\>:$ are equal and opposite (which act on different body)
	- are the same type
	!!! warning
		acceleration may be different (depending on the inertia of the system)



## quantity of object
// maybe put this somewhere else 
### mass
- quantity of inertia
- quantity of matter in an object
- scalar
??? note "how is mass found to be the cause inertia?"
	??? info "experiment"
		1. pick an object to be the standard unit mass
		2. push mass with reproducible force (use n3l)
		3. find acceleration
		4. push an unknown mass with the same force
		5. measure new acceleration
		6. mass is inversely proportional to acceleration
		7. (!) intertia is inversely proportional to acceleration
		8. mass is directly proportional to inertia
	??? info "(!) thought experiment"
		1. imagine two masses moving at constant velocity
		2. the momentum of heavier mass is greater
		3. applying the same force on both mass
		4. predict that more time neeeded for the mass with higher momentum to stop
### momentum

## torque / moment
