- conservative forces
    - work done is independent of path
    - $\mathcal{W} = \oint F \cdot ds = 0$
    - can be associated with a potential energy function
- nonconservative forces
    - work done depends on path
    - $\mathcal{W} = \oint F \cdot ds > 0$
    - cannot be associated with a potential energy function
## force and potential energy
- one dimensional
$$F(s) = -\frac{dU_{g}}{ds}$$
- three dimensional
$$\mathbf{F}(s) = -\nabla U$$
## gravitational force (weight)
!!! tip
	- gravitational field strength: force per unit mass on a masss placed in a gravitation field
$$\begin{align}
\text{Gravitational field strength of a mass}:\quad g = \frac{Gm}{r^{2}} \\
W_{a} = m_{a}\left( \frac{Gm}{r^{2}} \right)
\end{align}$$
!!! tip
	The gravitational force ($\mathcal{W}$) on mass(a) in the gravitation field of mass b
!!! info "law of gravitation"
	1. Every object in the universe attracts every other object in the universe with a gravitational force.
	2. The magnitude of the gravitational force between two objects isâ€¦
	    1. directly proportional to the product of their masses and
	    2. inversely proportional to the square of the separation between their centers
