	This field study:

	- force
	- motion
	- energy
	- wave

- dynamic: study of motion and force
- kinematic(case): study of motion without force 
- static(case): study of force without motion $a=0 , v=0$
- a system have energy if it can do work
- work is done when external force cause a change in energy of a system (work-energy theorem)
- [energetic](https://physics.info/motion/): study of change in form of energy due to phsyical process

!!! important "conservation law"
	- conservation of linear momentum (**clm**)
	- conservation of mass-energy (**cme**)
	- conservation of angualar momentum (**cam**)

*[energetic]: "The study of how energy changes forms and location during physical processes is called energetics, but the word is used more by scientists in fields outside of physics than inside."
