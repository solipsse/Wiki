!!! warning "currently [working on](classic/1-dynamic/work-and-energy/kinetic-energy)"
## Page that are finished or somewhat finished
- [friction](classic/1-dynamic/forces/1-friction/)
- [force](classic/1-dynamic/forces/)
- [circular motion](classic/1-dynamic/motion/2-circular/)
- [equilibrium](classic/1-dynamic/2-equilibrium/)
- [motion](classic/1-dynamic/motion/) to be redo
- [projectilie](classic/1-dynamic/motion/1-projectile/) to be redo
- [work and energy](classic/1-dynamic/work-and-energy/)

!!! tip
	Sometimes I use (!) which means, I am not sure and will come back to it.

	All pages are writen in markdown and use mathjax for Latex. Mkdocs is used to convert all the latex and markdown into equivalence hhtml structure.
## planning to do
- [oscillation](classic/1-dynamic/motion/3-oscillation/)

## main resource
- Mr Baxter M2 and M3 Revision note book
- Physic a level textbook is not good so I use [Physic Hypertextbook](https://physics.info)
- [MIT OCW Textbook](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-01sc-classical-mechanics-fall-2016/pages/online-textbook/)
