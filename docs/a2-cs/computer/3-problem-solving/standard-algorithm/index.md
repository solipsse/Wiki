# algorithm
## search

- linear
- binary (ordered array only)
	- more performant for large array

## sort

- bubble 
- insertion

!!! note
    performance factor:
    1. initial order
    2. number of item (both of them has complexity: O(n))
## adt algorithm
- stack: insert, delete, find
- queue: insert, delete, find
- graph: adjacency matrix and adjacency list
- binary tree: insert and find
## Queue

## linked list


### graph

## binary tree

!!! note
    - adjacency matrix: 2D arr, row -> col
        - $+$ easy to work with, adding edge is simple
        - $-$ graph with many nodes with little connection between all node will waste memory space
    - adjacency list: dictionary or set

!!! tip "list >> matrix"
